# Performance Review Templates

*Here are some sample performance review templates for **self** (your own work), **upward** (feedback you write for your manager), **downward** (feedback you as a manager write for your team members), and **peer** (feedback written for others in the organization) reviews. These can be customized to reflect company values or role levels and ladders.*

## Self Review Template

**Major Accomplishments:**
Over the review cycle, what major projects / work did you do, and what were the results of the work? Focus on the top 3-5 areas.

**Strengths & Areas of Impact:**
What are key strengths and ways these strengths were used to make clear impact?

**Areas for Development:**
What are key areas of improvement / things that may have held you back from accomplishing more?

## Upward Review Template
*Feedback for your manager*
